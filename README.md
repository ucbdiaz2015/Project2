This is a project I completed as I was learning to build iOS applications using Swift and XCode. It is a "mini instagram" that pulls popular posts from Instagram using Instagram's API. The posts are displayed on a feed that follows Instagram's own design (i.e. post header containing username and profile pic, image, caption, comments). The application allows you to click a header that takes you to a poster's profile where their profile header is displayed (profile pic, number of posts, number of followers, number of people following), followed by other posts they submitteed to Instagram.
